# 📸 Vnuchka Fantasta + Peter – Conceptual Overhead Photo Shoot

## 🎯 Concept Overview
Create a visually striking overhead (bird's eye) photograph that makes it appear as if Peter and Vnuchka Fantasta are *floating* amidst a futuristic, slightly apocalyptic world — using **real-world objects** only. This shoot leans into storytelling, music, and retro-futurism.

## 🧠 Creative Theme
**"Floating through a collapsing future with sound and memory as anchors."**

This visual juxtaposes calmness and connection against a chaotic backdrop, emphasizing individuality, creativity, and emotional depth.

## 🧥 Wardrobe & Styling

- **Peter**: Think vintage rebel — layered textures, scuffed boots, rings, and metal details.
- **Vnuchka Fantasta**: Contrasting or complementary — soft/dreamy or vibrant/techy.
- Cohesive color palette (e.g., rust, black, silver, muted neons)
- Hair styled naturally; allow wind or movement

## 🎨 Color Grading Notes
- Slight desaturation
- Cool-toned highlights, warm shadows
